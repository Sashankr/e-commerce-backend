Node.js to understand how backend application works.

I learned about :

1. Folder Structure of a node application.
2. Setting up connection to MongoDB using mongoose.
3. Using nodemon to start server from root file app.js
4. Defining the models for storing data in MongoDB in the models folder.
5. Defining routes inside routes folder and assigning controllers to each route to perform different actions based on the route.
6. Defining Controller functions that handle the actions based on request type : GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.
7. Using Middleware function to implement JWT authentication for all the apis under users route.
